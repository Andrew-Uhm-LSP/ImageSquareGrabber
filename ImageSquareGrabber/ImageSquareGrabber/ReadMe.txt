Simple image grabbing MFC application.

Double-click the center area of the application to open file explorer, choose an image file.

Pressing the Shift key on any section of the image will mark an area for screen capture, indicated by a green rectangle/square.
Pressing Space saves that section of image to D:\CroppedImages\[DateTime + Original Filename].

To change the dimensions of the rectangle itself, type new values in the boxes underneath "Current Width" and "Current Height" 
and click the "Apply" button.

ISSUE
- Always saves as a 32-bit image at the moment.
